# Rock_Paper_Scissor

If you've ever watched the "The Big Bang Theory" series then you are familiar with the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game and its "simple" rules! For this project, the user plays against the computer. I built this project as I am a huge fun of the series, but also, because I wanted to make good use of my newly acquired knowledge in semantic HTML syntax, CSS and JS functions.

You can find the deployed app here: https://artemis-p.github.io/Rock_Paper_Scissor/


## Basic Rules
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes scissors
- Scissors decapitates lizard
- Lizard eats paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes rock
- Rock crushes scissors


## User stories
